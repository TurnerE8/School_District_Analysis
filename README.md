# School_District_Analysis
##Anaconda, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook
This week's challenge focused on school district analysis. We did this by approaching our analysis using the following steps: 
  1. Collecting the data 
  2. Preparing the data
  3. Analyzing the data

The third step is, in my opinion, the most robust and we spent a considerable amount of time in this step. While analyzing the data, we summarized the data using various means of summary statistics. We then drilled down into the data (also called "targeted analysis"). Here we learned many functions (i.e. 'loc', 'iloc', etc.) Lastly, we compared subsets of data to each other to see if there were any relationships or additional insight gained from comparing items such as school types, budget and much more.
